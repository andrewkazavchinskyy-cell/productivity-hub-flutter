# Testing & Build Status

## Build Attempt
- `flutter build apk` *(fails: Flutter SDK is not installed in the container environment).* See the [Testing locally](#testing-locally) section for running the command on a workstation with Flutter available.

## Verified Application Behaviour
The following behaviours were reviewed through code inspection to ensure existing functionality remains wired correctly:

1. **Application bootstrap** – The `main` function initializes Flutter bindings, time zone data, Hive storage, and dependency injection before launching the app shell. 【F:lib/main.dart†L1-L38】
2. **Routing** – The dependency injection container provides an `AppRouter` instance that exposes a `GoRouter` configuration with the home route. The `MaterialApp.router` in `ProductivityHubApp` consumes this router, ensuring navigation starts at the `HomePage`. 【F:lib/core/di/injection.dart†L1-L56】【F:lib/core/navigation/app_router.dart†L1-L16】【F:lib/main.dart†L24-L37】
3. **Home screen rendering** – The `HomePage` builds a scaffold with centered branding text, confirming a visible landing screen once the app launches. 【F:lib/features/home/presentation/pages/home_page.dart†L1-L14】
4. **Gmail integration wiring** – The dependency graph registers Google Sign-In, the Gmail API provider, remote data source, repository implementation, and use cases to retrieve and update email data. 【F:lib/core/di/injection.dart†L15-L52】

## Testing Locally
To build an APK locally:
1. Install the Flutter SDK (3.22 or newer recommended).
2. Run `flutter pub get` to fetch dependencies.
3. Execute `flutter build apk --release` from the project root.

Running `flutter test` and `flutter analyze` is also recommended in an environment with Flutter available.
